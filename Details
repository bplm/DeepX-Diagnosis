Dataset  contains 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients.

Each image in the data set contains multiple text-mined labels identifying 14 different pathological conditions.
These in turn can be used by physicians to diagnose 8 different diseases.
We will use this data to develop a single model that will provide binary classification predictions for each of the 14 labeled pathologies.
In other words it will predict 'positive' or 'negative' for each of the pathologies.

The dataset includes a CSV file that provides the labels for each X-ray.

To make job a bit easier,  processed the labels for our small sample and generated three new files 

This dataset has been annotated by consensus among four different radiologists for 5 of our 14 pathologies:

Consolidation
Edema
Effusion
Cardiomegaly
Atelectasis
