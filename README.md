# DeepX-Diagnosis
Exploring medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras.
Some of the steps of building and evaluating this deep learning classifier model:

Pre-process and prepare a real-world X-ray dataset
Use transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification
Learn a technique to handle class imbalance
Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve
Visualize model activity using GradCAMs

Data preparation
Visualizing data
Preventing data leakage
Model Development
Addressing class imbalance
Leveraging pre-trained models using transfer learning
Evaluation
AUC and ROC curves
